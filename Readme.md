# Fancy shortcodes

Just a simple shortcode plugin for my personal blog. Adds a button to wordpress' rich editor for selecting specified shortcodes.
These shortcodes are specified under classes/map.php.


## Features

* Simple to use and to extend
* small, fast and reliable


## Notes

* The used theme has to support the css-rules specified by the map.php/shortcode declaration.
* The specified shortcode are just my prefered ones. If you want to specify your own, feel free to just remove them.


## Checklist

* Add more shortcodes ;)
